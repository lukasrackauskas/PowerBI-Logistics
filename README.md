PowerBI Project on Transportation Company Data

The analyzed period is Q3 of 2019. 
Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total profit margin, revenue per kilometer (KM), and costs per KM were essential for gaining an overview. 

Analysis by truck was also conducted to identify the best- and worst-performing trucks, examining average KM traveled and revenue per KM by truck type.

Customer analysis provided insights into the company's primary markets, with a focus on revenue and revenue per KM.

A case study answers the key issues:

1. Vehicle age does influence the company's profit. Vehicles from 2009 or earlier travel significantly fewer kilometers, and their profit margins are negative.
2. Some drivers have very high fuel consumption; however, this depends on the average weight hauled. The heavier the load, the more fuel the truck uses. Fuel consumption also varies based on time and location, so a deeper analysis would be needed to identify the least efficient trucks or drivers.
3. Analyzing the performance of dispatchers shows that P. Peterson generates more profit. Even though he operates more trucks, he manages to achieve a higher profit per truck—$21k—compared to J. Johnson, who generates only $5k per truck.
4. The company's highest revenue per kilometer comes from carrying loads that weigh between 100 and 500 kg.
